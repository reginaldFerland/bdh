# Baby Dragon Hatchling

## **Bridging the Gap Between Transformers and the Brain**

**Baby Dragon Hatchling (BDH)** is a biologically inspired large language model architecture that connects principles of deep learning with the foundations of neuroscience. Developed by researchers at [Pathway](https://pathway.com), BDH provides a theoretical and practical framework for understanding the emergence of reasoning and generalization in artificial systems.

This repository contains the official implementation from the paper:

## Overview

BDH represents a **scale-free, locally interacting network of neurons** capable of intrinsic reasoning dynamics. BDH scales like a Transformer on performance benchmarks—yet retains full interpretability and theoretical grounding in the fine-grained dynamics of neuron interactions.

**Key properties:**

- **Scale-free network topology** mimicking biological connectivity
- **Locally interacting neuron particles** with excitatory/inhibitory dynamics
- **Hebbian working memory** based on synaptic plasticity, displaying monosemanticity
- **GPU-friendly state-space formulation** for efficient implementation
- **Interpretable activations** that are sparse and positive

BDH formalizes a bridge between **neural computation and machine-based language understanding**. It shows how **macro reasoning behavior** in large AI models emerges from **micro-level neuron dynamics**, guided by principles of graph theory and local computation.

Empirically, BDH matches **GPT-2–scale Transformers** across language and translation tasks at equivalent parameter scales (10M–1B).

## Relation to Transformers

BDH and the Transformer share attention-inspired computation; however, BDH’s graph-based architecture makes its attention **emerge naturally from neuron-level interactions**, reflecting attention as seen in biological systems.

## Scaling Laws

BDH follows **Transformer-like scaling laws**, maintaining parameter efficiency while achieving interpretability at any scale.

## Installation and Training

```bash
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# train BDH on a toy dataset
python train.py

# train with custom log directory
python train.py --log_dir my_training_logs

# run tests
./run_tests.sh
# or individually
python tests/test_data_fixes.py
python tests/test_new_features.py
```

See the `tests/` directory for test documentation and the `examples/` directory for advanced training scripts.

**Training Logs**: All training runs automatically log to date-stamped files in the `logs/` directory (or a custom directory specified with `--log_dir`). Each log file contains timestamped entries for training progress, validation metrics, and checkpointing events.

<!--For visualization and interpretability analysis, explore the example notebooks in `notebooks/`.-->
